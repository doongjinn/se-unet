# se-unet
I tried to make a new segmentation model using se-block(from senet) and attn-block(from attention unet)

# Dataset
I used kvasir-SEG which is an open-access dataset of gastrointestinal polyp images and corresponding segmentation masks, manually annotated by a medical doctor and then verified by an experienced gastroenterologist.  
I got this dataset from https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/kvasir-seg
